## About 
BadRotations
Maintained By: CuteOne

-- Intro --
BadRotations is maintained by CuteOne with additonal contributions from other developers who worked on combat rotation bots such as PQR, ProbablyEngine, and others. 
While it is more of a developer playground as compared to the more "for profit" bots this is free to use and we feel it is just as good, if not better, than the bots you pay money for. 
Dont agree? Feel free to post any issues you have and we will do our best to resolve them. **Please note that FireHack/Easy WoW Toolbox is required to use this.

-- Features --
- Object Manager
- Ground Spells Support 
- Healing Engine
- Clean User Interface w/ Profile Specific Toggle Buttons and Bot/Profile Specific Options
- Debug Frame
- And much more as new features and improvements are constantly added.

-- Profile Sellers/Stealers -- 
BadRotations is a free project for anyone to use and contribute to but we do ask that none of the code used here be taken or sold without permission.

-- Join the Team --
